# GPU-Accelerated, Deterministic ML Dev Environments with Docker and CUDA

This repository is a demo of how to use a GPU accelerated project from within a Docker container, while having deterministic development environments.

There is an accompanying blog post at Make Art with Python about how to use this image, and how to export a specific commit. It's meant to be a place of discussion for how to improve the current state of local machine learning development environments.

## Pre-Commit with pre-commit

This repository uses [https://pre-commit.com/](pre-commit) for building and pushing its container images before every commit.
